## on off system 
in on off systems by using a push button, with a single change (on or off) with every push 
<br/> with keeping the new state when release the button
<br/> The flipflop sounds the perfect solution, precisouly the T flipflop
<br/> The T flipflop change the output state when the toggle is high , and keep it when the toggle is low 
<br/> T flipflop truth table : 
| T       | Qnext           | state  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 0     | Q | not change |
| 1      | Q*      |   chang |
