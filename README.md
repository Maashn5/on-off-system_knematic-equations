## on off system 
in on off systems by using a push button, with a single change (on or off) with every push 
<br/> with keeping the new state when release the button
<br/> The flipflop sounds the perfect solution, precisouly the T flipflop
<br/> The T flipflop change the output state when the toggle is high , and keep it when the toggle is low 
<br/> T flipflop truth table :

<br/> Since tinkercad doesn't support T-flipflop, we will use the j-k flipflop
